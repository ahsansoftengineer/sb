## Contract 
#### CQRS
### Purpose of this Layer
- The contract layer is a layer that is sometimes used in Clean Architecture to define the interface that other layers should use to interact with the domain layer. It serves as a bridge between the domain layer and the rest of the App, providing a clear and consistent interface for the other layers to use.

- Note that the contract layer is not a requirement for Clean Architecture, and some implementations may choose to skip this layer, instead defining the interfaces directly in the domain layer. The important thing is to provide a clear separation between the domain layer and the other layers, regardless of whether a contract layer is used or not.

### Depends on
- For Now it is not also depends on Other Layer just like Domain Layer

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the "Contract Layer" isn't a formal term you typically find in DDD literature. However, based on the context and usage, it likely refers to the layer or components involved in defining and handling the interfaces and contracts between different parts of the system, especially in a distributed architecture.

In a DDD context, you can think of the Contract Layer as encompassing the following elements:

1. **APIs and Services**: This includes RESTful APIs, gRPC services, or any other service endpoints that expose the capabilities of your domain to other systems or components. These are the interfaces through which external systems interact with your domain.

2. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: These objects are used to transfer data between different parts of the system, especially across network boundaries. DTOs are often used to encapsulate data that is sent to or received from an API.

3. **Interfaces and Protocols**: These define the contracts that different components or services must adhere to. For instance, interfaces for repositories, services, and event handlers.

4. **Documentation and Specifications**: This includes OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for RESTful APIs, protocol buffers for gRPC, or other forms of service contracts that define the expected behavior, inputs, and outputs of the services.

5. **Versioning and Compatibility**: Handling different versions of the API and ensuring backward compatibility. This is crucial in maintaining a contract that evolves over time without breaking existing consumers.

In summary, the Contract Layer in DDD involves the definition and management of the communication and interaction agreements between various parts of the system, ensuring that they can work together cohesively while adhering to the principles of domain-driven design.
